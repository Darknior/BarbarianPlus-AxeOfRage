 There are 3 crows in this rar:

 Crow1 : Waits in spawned spot, if player is close enough flies backward, stop then flies toward player. Stops after that then flies toward player again and the cycle repeats
 Crow2 : Same as #1 but flies away after flying toward player
 Crow3 : Flies in then waits in mid air, if player is close enough, flies toward player then flies away

 These crows are tested in Castlevania Collab demo and all of them works
